## Team Values

- Attend meetings on time and come prepared with tasks completed
- Let the team know if there are problems with completing tasks and if help is needed
- Always be willing to help other team members even if it wasn’t our specific task
- We should try to get everyone’s input throughout the meeting as well as we shouldn’t be afraid to bring up things we could improve (pros/cons) – avoiding groupthink
- Should be on the same page, everyone should be on the same page when it comes to what we implement and where we are at in the lifecycle of the software
- Try to support each other and get to know each other


## Team Communication
- Primary messaging via Slack
- Response within 12 hours and at least an acknowledgement of messages like reacting with emojis so that everyone knows that you’ve read it
- Actively participate in meetings and if unable to attend meeting, advance notice should be given
- Keep meeting minutes of important meetings
